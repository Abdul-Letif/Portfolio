# Sales Dashboard

This project demonstrates how business intelligence (BI) techniques can be applied to analyze and visualize sales performance. Using realistic dummy data, I developed a two-page Power BI dashboard that highlights key sales and profit metrics, helping business users track performance, identify top products, and assess profitability across regions and customer segments.

## Project Objectives

- Showcase how Power BI can support sales and profitability analysis through interactive dashboards
- Provide insights into regional performance, product trends, and sales representative contributions
- Demonstrate my ability to design visually appealing, data-driven dashboards using synthetic but realistic data

## KPIs

The dashboard highlights:

- Total Sales
- Total Units Sold
- Total Profit
- Average Profit Margin

## Dashboard Pages
### 1. Sales Dashboard

- Regional performance breakdown (Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East & Africa)
- Sales trends over time (2022–2024)
- Customer segment analysis (Enterprise, Individual, Small Business)
- Monthly sales trends with seasonality insights
- Top 10 product subcategories by units sold
- Sales representative ranking by sales amount

### 2. Profit Dashboard

- Profit by product category and region
- Monthly profit trends for 2022–2024
- Profit by customer segment
- Top 10 product subcategories by average profit margin
- Sales representative ranking by profit contribution

## My Role & Skills Applied

## Limitations

Due to Power BI service restrictions, the report cannot be embedded publicly.

## Tools Used

- Dataset: Synthetic sales data
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel (for data generation and preparation)
- DAX (for measures and KPIs)
