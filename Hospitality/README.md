# Hospitality Performance Dashboard

This project demonstrates how business intelligence (BI) techniques can be applied to the hospitality industry to monitor performance and improve decision-making. Using synthetic but realistic hotel data from realworldfakedata.com
, I developed a two-page Power BI dashboard that analyzes hotel performance, guest behavior, and revenue streams.

## Project Objectives

- Explore how Power BI dashboards can support decision-making in the hospitality sector
- Provide property-level insights on reservations, revenue, and booking patterns
- Showcase my ability to design interactive reports using a real-world-style dataset

## KPIs

The dashboard highlights:
- Total Reservations: 99K
- Total Revenue: $108.7M
- Average Room Rate: $147.25
- Average Duration of Stay: 7.49 days

## Dashboard Pages
### 1. Reservation Overview

- Breakdown of reservation status (completed, no-show, extended, reduced)
- Distribution of booking channels (website, phone app, travel agent, call center, walk-in)
- Advanced booking analysis (booked ahead vs. last-minute)
- Monthly reservation trends across the year.

### 2. Revenue Analysis

- Revenue by property (The Sankey, The Marimekko, The Chord)
- Monthly revenue trends for individual properties
- Revenue by room type (Double, Suite, Executive Suite, etc.)
- High-level view of overall revenue distribution across categories.

## My Role & Skills Applied

- Designed and structured a two-page Power BI dashboard for executive insights
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset in Microsoft Excel
- Developed calculated KPIs and measures using DAX
- Applied best practices in data visualization and storytelling for hospitality management.

## Limitations

Due to Power BI service restrictions, the report cannot be embedded publicly.

## Tools Used

- Dataset: realworldfakedata.com
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning)
