# Precision Cattle Production Analysis

This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can be applied to dairy farming for better decision-making. Using synthetic data, I designed and developed a Power BI dashboard that evaluates the performance of dairy cattle across multiple farms within the same region.

## Project Objectives

- Showcase how data analysis can be used to monitor cattle productivity and efficiency
- Provide an interactive tool for comparing farms, age groups, and cattle strains
- Explore how business intelligence tools can support precision livestock farming.

## KPIs

The dashboard tracks and summarizes:
- Average efficiency
- Average milk yield
- Average feed intake
- Average body weight

## Features

- Metric Selector: Choose to analyze efficiency, feed intake, milk yield, or weight
- Comparison Views: Visualize metrics across farms, age groups, and strains
- Filter Options: Refine analysis by cattle condition.

## My Role & Skills Applied

- Generated synthetic livestock data with ChatGPT for analysis
- Cleaned and structured data in Microsoft Excel
- Built calculated measures and KPIs using DAX
- Designed the dashboard layout and user interactions in Power BI

## Limitations

Due to Power BI service restrictions, the report cannot be embedded publicly.

## Tools Used

- ChatGPT (for data generation)
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning)
- DAX (for calculated fields)
